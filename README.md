# FreeForAll_ManOfWar_AS2
A mod that adds the FFA mode from previous instalments. Modified by me for stable work on the latest versions of the game.

## INSTALLATION.
1. In the root directory of the game create a Mods folder (if it is there, of course, do not do it).
2. In the Mods folder put the folder with the mod (check the version and the name of the folder).
3. Start the game and go to the settings menu, select the Mods tab in the left list select the desired mod and click on it twice (it should move to the right table), then click connect mod, ready.
> [!NOTE]
> If the mod is marked grey and you can not connect it in the settings, then you need to change the versions in the file mod. info, which is located in mods / downloaded mod / mod. info. Open it with notepad and change the version
